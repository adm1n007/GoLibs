## What is GoQt
GoQt is a GUI toolkit for the Go programming language. It allows Go programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Golang extension module (cgo code) that wraps the popular Qt cross platform GUI library, which is written in C++.

Like Golang and Qt, GoQt is Open Source. The Golang extension module(cgo code) under the BSD license. The C++ bindings library under the LGPL license.
